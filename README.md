### Extracts text from a document (pdf, docx, txt, py, html, md), and asks LM Studio about it, simulating a vector database.

## Installation
> ‚ÄºÔ∏è I have only tested it with üêç[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/) or [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/) (I have not tested above 3.11.).

Step 1 - Download the repo files in the latest release.

Step 2 - Open a command prompt in the folder that contains ```main.py``` and create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .
```

Step 3 - Activate virtual environment
  > On Linux or MacOS, run source bin/activate ```source bin/activate``` instead.
```
.\Scripts\activate
```

Step 4 - Upgrade Pip
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Step 5 - Install Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Within the virtual environment run:
```
python main.py
```
> ‚ÄºÔ∏è Don't forget to activate the virtual environment in the proper folder each time you want to use it.
