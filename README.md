### Extracts text from a document (pdf, docx, and txt), curates it, and asks LM Studio about it, simulating a vector database.

## Installation
> ‚ÄºÔ∏è Make sure to have üêç[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/) (haven't tested higher).  Also, you must have both [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) installed.<br>
> ‚ÄºÔ∏è For any commands that begin with ```python``` or ```pip``` in these instructions, if you installed Python 3 but still have Python 2 installed, you should use ```Python3``` or ```pip3``` instead to make sure that the correct version of Python is used.

Step 1 - Download the repo files in the latest release.

Step 2 - Open a command prompt in the folder with ```gui.py``` and create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .
```

Step 3 - Activate virtual environment
  > On Linux or MacOS, run source bin/activate ```source bin/activate``` instead.
```
.\Scripts\activate
```

Step 4 - Upgrade Pip
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Step 5 - Install Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Within the virtual environment run:
```
python gui.py
```
> ‚ÄºÔ∏è Don't forget to activate the virtual environment in the proper folder each time you want to use it.
